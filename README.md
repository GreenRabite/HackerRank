# HackerRank

This repo will be a walkthrough of my thoughts and processes in tackling each of these HackerRank problems. I will mainly tackle it in this order:

```
1. Restate the problem and ask any clarifying questions to understand the problem
2. Provide some sample I/O
3. Go through any approaches I am thinking about and state the time complexity and space complexity for each approach
4. Pick an approach and perform out the pseudo code for that approach
5. Solve the question
```
